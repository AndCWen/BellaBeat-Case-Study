# BellaBeat-Case-Study

Upon completion of my Google Data Analytics certificate, I had to complete a case study on a wellness tech manufacturer that develops health-focused smart products for women. The goal of this analysis was to use the health tracker data to identify trends in smart device usage and use those trends to come up with suggestions for the company's marketing strategy. I utiilized R for this analysis. 

Some data I examined included the relationship between calorie burn and minutes spent sedantary. Based on this information, I would suggest Bellabeat set a reminder for users to get some activity when their time spend sedantary approached 1000 minutes:

The relationship between time of day and steps taken. For Bellabeat, this information shows that if users are falling behind on their daily steps goal, between 6 and 7PM would be a good time of day to remind them to get more steps in.

And the realtionship between calorie burn and exercise intensity. Based on this data, I suggested Bellabeat to encourage to users to ramp up the intensity of their activity while they are performing lower intensity exercise if their primary goal is to burn more calories:

## My Conclusions
There appears to be a relationship between minutes spent sedentary and total daily calories burned when someone is sedentary for over 1000 minutes a day.
People tend to take the most steps between the hours of 6PM and 7PM, and take very few steps betwwen 9PM and 6AM.
The higher the average intensity of an activity, the more calories an individual will burn during that activity.
Based on these conclusions, I would suggest Bellabeat to send nudges to their users depending on the user's specified goals. Using data to see common trends in activity, Bellabeat can offer customized notifications with the right timing to keep users on track.
